     * 2. Link the plug-in code.
     * 3. Locate the plug-in entrypoint function, "LoadPlugin".
     * 4. Call the entrypoint function, providing the plug-in
     *    with access to the server.  The plug-in will return
     *    a function the server can call later to unload the plug-in.
     *    The plug-in can signal a "failure to load" or other
     *    kind of fatal error simply by leaving the "unload"
     *    delegate as a nullptr.

     * @param[in] pluginName
     *     This is the name identifying the plug-in in any diagnostic
     *     messages relating to the plug-in.
     *
     * @param[in] pluginsRuntimePath
     *     This is the path to where a copy of the plug-in code
     *     is made, in order to link the code without locking
     *     the original code image.  This is so that the original
     *     code image can be updated even while the plug-in is loaded.
     *
     * @param[in,out] server
     *     This is the server for which to load the plug-in.
